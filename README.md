Credit Card Fraud Detection – Project Documentation
📘 Project Title:
Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

👤 Team/Author:
Sudalai Eswari S

📌 Objective:
To build a machine learning model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy and low false positive rate.

📂 Dataset:
Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Size: 284,807 transactions

Features:

Time, Amount, V1–V28 (PCA anonymized features)

Class: Target column (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)

🧠 Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (ML Algorithms)

Google Colab (Execution)

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Highly imbalanced: ~0.17% are fraud cases.

No missing values.

Strong need for resampling or anomaly detection.

⚙️ Preprocessing Steps:
Dropped the Time column.

Normalized Amount using StandardScaler.

Split data into training and test sets (70/30).

🤖 Machine Learning Model:
Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier

Why? Fast, accurate, handles imbalanced data reasonably well.

📊 Evaluation Metrics:
Confusion Matrix

Precision / Recall / F1-Score

Focused on Recall (catching frauds is more important than false alarms)
